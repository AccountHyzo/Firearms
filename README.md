*Overall firearms overhaul.*

![Firearms B41](/poster.png "Title card")

**Adds several new guns:**  
- Glock 17
- Colt Single Action Army
- MP5
- Winchester 1894
- M24
- Sawn-off Hunting Rifle

**New models for all vanilla firearms**  

**Working silencers to specific weapons by caliber.**  
Excluded from silencers are:
- MSR 788
- Desert Eagle

3D Models for attachments such as slings, recoil pads and bipods.  
Removes the requirement to have a screwdriver to add and remove attachments to guns.  

This mod is a work in progress and I will continue to add attachments and guns as well as replace vanilla models.  
Please consider this when subscribing. There is a possibility for things to change.  
Tested and works to the best of my knowledge with B41.78.16 Please post if you encounter bugs so I can fix them.
